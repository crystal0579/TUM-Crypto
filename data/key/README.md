* `public javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec(byte[] key, int offset, int len, String algorithm)`
* `public javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec(byte[] key, String algorithm)`

A sample is labeled insecure iff all usage patterns for the elements mentioned above are insecure. A sample is labeled secure iff all usage patterns are secure.
